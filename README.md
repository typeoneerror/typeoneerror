### Hello 👋

#### I'm Benjamin Borowski, a product designer & developer based in beautiful British Columbia.

For over 15 years, I've strategically planned and expertly executed digital experiences that delight, engage, and ultimately build stronger brands.

I specialize in high-level technical strategies & full-stack development on web and mobile apps. I'm happiest solving tough technical challenges and building products with my favourite technologies including Ruby/Rails, Ember/Javascript, PHP, and Objective-C.
