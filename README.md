## Hello 👋

### I'm Benjamin Borowski, a product designer & developer based in beautiful British Columbia.

For close to two decades, I've strategically planned and expertly executed digital experiences that delight, engage, and ultimately build stronger brands.

I specialize in high-level technical strategies & full-stack development on web and mobile apps. I'm happiest solving tough technical challenges and building products with my favourite technologies including Ruby/Rails, Ember/Javascript, PHP, and Objective-C.

You can find out more about me on my [personal website](https://typeoneerror.com).
